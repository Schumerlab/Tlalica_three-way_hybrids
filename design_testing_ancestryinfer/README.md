# Designing and testing the three-way mode of *ancestryinfer*

The updated version of *ancestryinfer* which includes a three reference genome mode can be found at https://github.com/Schumerlab/ancestryinfer.git . Simulations acan also be found here. Additional information about designing and testing can be found in the methods section, Supporting information 1, and Appendix1_User_manual_3way_ancestryinfer.pdf from Banerjee & Powell et al. in press. All test datasets were ran with the same input files and paramaters designed in the ../local_ancestry_calling/ancestryinfer_3way_config_file.cfg.
