# Pipeline for sppIDer analysis

This is a cleaned pipeline for preliminary invedtigation of ancestry contribution of the first two putative three way hybrids identified at Tlalica using sppIDer (Langdon et al. 2018). This analysis is presented in Banerjee & Powell et al. *in press*, where we identify hybrids of *Xiphophorus variatus*, *X. malinche*, and *X. birchmanni*.

Scripts used for this analysis can be found at https://github.com/GLBRC/sppIDer.

Results of this analysis were plotted usinf sppIDer_plot.R.
